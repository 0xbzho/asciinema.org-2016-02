The user name had to be longer than 5 characters, and could not include any characters \u0026lt; 31. The set of operations was tricky, but basically set the last byte of the username to 0\u0026#39;s, took the 4th char of the username ^ 0x1337 + 0x5EEDED and used this for the start of the sum. Then it would go through the username string char by char and and add the sum ^ curChar  and mod it by 1337.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEventually I managed to suss out the pattern by keeping the username consistent (\u0026#39;ddddddd\u0026#39;) and working through the program by hand. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","Time":"2016-02-03T23:01:34Z","Tags":["Linux","bash","rxvt-unicode-256color"]}
